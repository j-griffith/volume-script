This is a modified version of devstack/exercises/volumes.sh.  
It only runs the volumes portions of the exercise and includes a snapshot create/delete sequence.

To install just drop it in your ~/devstack/exercises directory.

Run this just like the other devstack exercises scripts (source ~/devstack/openrc) then ./vol-test.sh
